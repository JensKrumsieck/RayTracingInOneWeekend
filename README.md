# Pathtracer

This repository contains a Pathtracer, created by following the the Ray Tracing in One Weekend book series available at https://raytracing.github.io/ 

The Pathtracer is currently using the CPU to render as done in the books although the GUI is using Vulkan and ImGUI using [Catalyze](https://github.com/JensKrumsieck/Catalyze).
